## Overview

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_dotcom %} is a chat interface that lets you ask and receive answers to coding-related questions on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}.

{% note %}

**Note**: {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} is also available in selected IDEs. For information on using {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} in an IDE, see "[AUTOTITLE](/copilot/github-copilot-chat/using-github-copilot-chat-in-your-ide)."

{% endnote %}

{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} can help you with a variety of coding-related tasks, like offering you code suggestions, providing natural language descriptions of a piece of code's functionality and purpose, generating unit tests for your code, and proposing fixes for bugs in your code. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/copilot/github-copilot-enterprise/copilot-chat-in-github/about-github-copilot-chat-in-githubcom)."

On {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom_the_website %}, you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} to ask:

- General software-related questions, without a particular context. For more information, see "[Asking a general question about software development](#asking-a-general-question-about-software-development)."
- Exploratory questions asked in the context of a specific repository. For more information, see "[Asking exploratory questions about a repository](#asking-exploratory-questions-about-a-repository)."
- Questions asked in the context of a specific repository, file or symbol. For more information, see "[Asking a question about a specific file or symbol](#asking-a-question-about-a-specific-file-or-symbol)."
- Questions asked in the context of a knowledge base (that is, Markdown documentation across one or more repositories). For more information, see "[Asking a question about a knowledge base](#asking-a-question-about-a-knowledge-base)."
- Questions about a specific file or specified lines of code within a file. For more information, see "[Asking questions about specific pieces of code](#asking-questions-about-specific-pieces-of-code)."
- Questions about a pull request diff. For more information, see "[Finding out about the changes in a pull request](#finding-out-about-the-changes-in-a-pull-request)."

### Limitations

- Chat responses may be suboptimal if you ask questions about a specific repository that you've selected as a context, and the repository has not been indexed for semantic code search. Anyone who gets access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} from the organization that owns a repository can index that repository. For more information, see "[Asking a question about a specific repository, file or symbol](#asking-a-question-about-a-specific-repository-file-or-symbol)."
- The quality of the results from {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_short %} may, in some situations, be degraded if very large files, or a large number of files, are used as a context for a question.

## Prerequisites

{% data reusables.copilot.chat-subscription-prerequisite %}
- To use {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_dotcom %}, you must have been granted access to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat %} as part of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_enterprise %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/copilot/github-copilot-enterprise/overview/enabling-github-copilot-enterprise-features)."

## Powered by skills

Under the hood, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} is powered by a collection of skills that are dynamically selected based on the question you ask. You can tell which skill was selected by {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} based on the status updates in the chat window.

You can also explicitly ask {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_dotcom %} to use a particular skill - for example, `Use the Bing skill to find the latest GPT4 model from OpenAI`.

### Currently available skills

{% note %}

**Note**: You can generate this list yourself by asking {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}: `What skills do you have available?`

{% endnote %}

| Skill | Description | Enabled by default? | Example question |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------ | -------------|
| `codesearch` | Natural language code search in the default branch of the Git repository. This skill is useful when you want to know where or how certain functionality has been implemented in the code. Note: this requires indexing to be enabled for the repository (see the note above indexing [below](#repo-indexing-note)). | Yes | _Where is the logic that controls the user session management, and how does it work?_ |
| `show-symbol-definition` | Retrieves the lines of code that define a specific code symbol (function, class, or struct) in the default branch of the Git repository. This skill is useful when you have the exact name of a symbol, and want to understand it. | Yes | _Write unit tests for the AuthUser method_ |
| `pathsearch` | Retrieves a specific file in the default branch of the Git repository. This skill is useful when you provide the exact path of a file in the repository. | Yes | _What logic does user_auth.js encapsulate?_ |
| `bing-search` | Searches the web using the Bing search engine. This skill is useful for teaching Copilot about recent events, new developments, trends, technologies, or extremely specific, detailed, or niche subjects. | No (requires admin approval - see "[AUTOTITLE](/copilot/github-copilot-enterprise/overview/enabling-github-copilot-enterprise-features)")| _What are some recent articles about SAT tokens securing against vulnerabilities in Node?_ |

## Asking a general question about software development

You can ask a general question about software development that is not focused on a particular context, such as a repository or a knowledge base.

Depending on the question you ask, and your enterprise and organization settings, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} may respond using information based on the results of a Bing search. By using Bing search, {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} can answer a broad range of tech-related questions with up-to-date details based on information currently available on the internet. For information on how to enable or disable Bing search integration, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-copilot-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-to-manage-the-use-of-github-copilot-features-on-githubcom)."

{% note %}

**Note:** Bing search integration into {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_chat_dotcom_short %} is currently in beta and is subject to change.
