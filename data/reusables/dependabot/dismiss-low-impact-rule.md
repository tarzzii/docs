The `Dismiss low impact issues for development-scoped dependencies` is a {% data variables.product.company_short %} preset rule. This rule auto-dismisses certain types of vulnerabilities that are found in npm dependencies used in development. The rule has been curated to reduce false positives and reduce alert fatigue. The rule is enabled by default for public repositories and can be opted into for private repositories. However, you cannot modify {% data variables.dependabot.github_presets %}. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-auto-triage-rules/using-github-preset-rules-to-prioritize-dependabot-alerts)."
